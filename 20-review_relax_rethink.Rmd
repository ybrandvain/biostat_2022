The Science of Doubt. [link](https://youtu.be/cESuNcx28_I?t=680). By Michael Whitlock.    
```


## Review / Setup   

- So much of stats aims to learn the TRUTH.    

- We focus so much on our data and how to measure uncertainty around estimates and (in)compatibility of data with a null model. We will review and solidify this, but     
- Recognize that so much beyond sampling error can mislead us.    

##  How science goes wrong     

Watch the video below. Whe you do, consider these types of errors that accompanny science. You should be able to think about htese and as good questions about them.

- Fraud.  
- Wrong models.     
- Experimental design error.    
- Communication error.  
- Statistician error.    
- Harking.      
- Coding error.    
- Technical Error.  
- Publication bias.   


You should have something to say about   

- The "replication crisis", and 
- If/why preregistration of studies is a good idea.    

```{r, whitlock,fig.cap = "Watch this hour long  [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWCtoVt1CJM) on *The science of Doubt* by Michael Whitlock.", echo=FALSE, out.extra= 'allowfullscreen'}

```

**A brief word on publication bias** Scientists are overworked and have too much to do. They get more rewards for publishing statistically significant results, so those are usually higher on the to do list. This results in the *file drawer effect* in which non-significant results are less likely to be submitted for publication.

##  Review   

You should be pretty comfortable with the ideas of   

- Parameters vs Estimates    
- Sampling and what can go wrong   
- Uncertainty 
- The sampling distribution
- Null hypothesis significance testing   
    - False positives
    - False Negatives
    - What a p-value is and is not
