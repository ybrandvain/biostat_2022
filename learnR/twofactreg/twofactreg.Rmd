# more predictors


## set up 


People often refer to backwards or thinking as being like a neanderthal, but it’s not clear neanderthals were dumb (in fact some evidence suggests they were smarter than humans).

Until the next Encino man documentary it will be hard to know for sure. But we can compare the size of Neanderthal and human brains.


```{r,  fig.height=2.4,fig.width=7.5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
a <- ggplot(brains, aes(x = species, y = lnBrain, color = species))+
  geom_sina(size = 2,show.legend = FALSE)+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("pink","cornflowerblue"))+
  stat_summary(color = "black")+
  labs(y = "Brain mass (ln scale)",title = "a")

b <- ggplot(brains, aes(x = lnMass, y = lnBrain))+
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = .5)+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)+
  labs(x = "Body mass (ln scale)",
       y = "Brain mass (ln scale)",title = "b")

c <-  ggplot(brains, aes(x = species, y = lnMass, color = species))+
  geom_sina(size = 2,show.legend = FALSE)+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("pink","cornflowerblue"))+
  stat_summary(color = "black")+
  labs(y = "Body mass (ln scale)",title = "c")

a+b+c
```


We can see that there is no obvious relationship between species and brain size (**a**), in this sample. But brain size clearly increases with body size (**b**), and neanderthals in this sample are larger than humans (**c**). The results of simple linear models below make these points quantitatively

```{r,echo=TRUE}
lm(lnBrain ~  species, data = brains) %>% tidy()
```


```{r,echo=TRUE}
lm(lnBrain ~  lnMass, data = brains) %>% tidy()
```

```{r,echo=TRUE}
lm(lnMass ~  species, data = brains) %>% tidy()
```


So we definitely can’t reject the null that brain sizes don’t differ without accounting for body mass.

But do neanderthals and humans have different sized brains after we account for differences in body size? Let’s find out!



```{r bestorder, echo=FALSE}
question("In a linear model relating to this problem, which is the best order for the variables?",
  answer("lm(lnBrain ~ species + lnMass, data = brains)"),
  answer("lm(lnBrain ~ lnMass + species, data = brains)", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Order doesn't matter"),
  answer("None of these are correct"),
   allow_retry = TRUE,   
    correct = random_praise(),
    incorrect = random_encouragement()
  )
```

Both of the following models produce the same t-values and p-values

```{r spmass_v_masssp, echo=FALSE}
lm1 <- lm(lnBrain ~  species + lnMass, data = brains)
lm2 <- lm(lnBrain ~   lnMass + species, data = brains)
summary.lm(lm2)
```



```{r interp1, echo=FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Interpretation 1",
question("Which rows above are the least usefull and potentially misleading",
  answer("Estimate and Std. Error"),
  answer("t value and Pr(>|t|)", correct = TRUE),
   allow_retry = TRUE,   
    correct = random_praise(),
    incorrect = random_encouragement()
  ),
question("Which p-values allow us to draw strong conclusions (select all that apply)",
  answer("(Intercept"),
  answer("lnMass"),
  answer("speciesrecent"),
  answer("none of these", correct = TRUE),
   allow_retry = TRUE,   
    correct = random_praise(),
    incorrect = random_encouragement()
  )
)
```

```{r play1, exercise=TRUE, eval = FALSE}

```

Use the output above to predict the brain size of a neanderthal with a `lnMass` of 4.3


The log brain size of a neanderthal with a `lnMass` of 4.3 is predicted to have a log mass of __ (include one point past the decimal, type -99 for no answer)


```{r neand_43, echo = FALSE}
question_text(
  "The brain size of a neanderthal with a `lnMass` of 4.3 is predicted to have a log mass of __ (include one point past the decimal, type -99 for no answer)",
  answer("7.3", correct = TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```



```{r play2, exercise=TRUE, eval = FALSE}

```


The brain size of a human with a `lnMass` of 4.3 is predicted to have a log mass of __ (include one point past the decimal, type -99 for no answer)



```{r human_43, echo = FALSE}
question_text(
  "The brain size of a human with a `lnMass` of 4.3 is predicted to have a log mass of __ (include one point past the decimal, type -99 for no answer)",
  answer("7.4", correct = TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### Examine the anova table below


```{r}
tibble(thing = c("lnMass","species","Residuals"),
       df = c("a","b",36),

       Mean.Sq = c("d","e",0.00444),
       F.value = c("f",6.2,""),
       P.value = c(2.72e-05,"f",""))
```

Evaluate these plot to see if data appear to meet assumptions of a linear regression

autoplot(lm2)
