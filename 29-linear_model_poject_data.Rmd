## Potential data sets 

Spend the weekend pushing forward on your linear model project.

Recall that a major assumption of linear models is that errors are normally distributed. 

Although linear models are robust to minor violations of these assumptions, they are not a good choice for a categorical response variable -- so if your early analyses had categorical response variables you probably need a  new data set. Here are some  currated options.

### Consequences  of extinction {-}
